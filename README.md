# Bing's Wallpaper Downloader
This is a simple browser extension to download Bing's daily wallpaper.

## Installation

There are no plans to release this addon on Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons or Microsoft Store. In the future it will be released for self-distribution, but for now it's served as is. If you want to sideload it, follow the instructions for your browser. The current version (1.0) is tested on Firefox and Firefox only.

## Use

The extension works by adding a button in the bottom right corner of [bing.com](https://www.bing.com).  Click it and it will download the wallpaper.  As of September 2019, it keeps the original filename but removes the "OHR." appendix.
